        MODESTY<br><br>

        TIME: _The present._ <br><br>

        SCENE: _A drawing-room. Entrance_, C; _sofa, chairs, writing-desk._<br>
        JACQUES _and_ HENRIETTE _enter_ C, _from dinner_. HENRIETTE _in<br>
        ball costume_, JACQUES _in evening dress. They come down_ C.<br><br>
   
        HENRIETTE. What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?<br><br>
        
        JACQUES. You can easily guess.<br><br>
        
        HENRIETTE. You're so long-winded. You make me weary--come to the point.<br><br>
        
        JACQUES. I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. I<br>
        am unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?<br><br>
        
        HENRIETTE. Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such<br>
        good friends! And now you're going to be angry.<br><br>
        
        JACQUES. Why?<br><br>
        
        HENRIETTE. Because I'm not going to give you the sort of answer you'd<br>
        like.
